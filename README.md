# Todo List

Simple Todo List where you can create tasks, check them as done, edit the description and delete them. This project was made with React, Django, MySql and Docker.

## Run the project
As we use Docker thereÂ´s the advantage that everything you need to run this project is `Docker`. There are two separate containers one for the backend and one for the frontend. To run both I used `Docker-Compose`. 

```
docker-compose up --build
```
- This command will up the two 'services' defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

</p>

The API is running on the port 8000 in localhost. And the frontend is running on a nginx so the default port is 80.

To follow the python standard I used a package named `flake8` which check your code for identation, spaces, comments, length of a line, etc. 

Also I try to follow TDD which is in generally words to make a test first and then create the code to that test pass.
